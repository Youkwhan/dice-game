# Dice Dispute

Dice Dispute is a simple and fun way to settle disputes between two or more people. Whether you're trying to decide who should do the dishes or who gets the last slice of pizza, you can roll the dice and let fate decide.

## How to Play

1. Each player rolls a dice.
2. The player with the highest number wins the dispute.
3. If there's a tie, both players roll again until a winner is determined.

That's it! You can use any kind of dice you like, as long as they have the same number of sides.

## Why Dice?

Dice are a time-tested mechanic for games and disputes alike. They're simple, efficient, and impartial. Plus, they add an element of chance that makes things more exciting.

Many decades of wargame design have explored alternatives to dice, but none have proven as reliable or versatile. Whether you're playing a board game, a tabletop RPG, or settling a dispute with a friend, dice are a tried-and-true solution.
